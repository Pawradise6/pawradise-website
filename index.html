            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>Pawradise ($PAWX) is more than a memecoin; it's a bridge between our community and animal shelters. We created this project with the firm belief that cryptocurrencies can be a force for good. Our objective is simple yet powerful: to use the power of streaming and our community's spirit to fund animal shelters that work tirelessly to give animals a second chance.</p>
            <p>With every interaction and contribution, Pawradise becomes a symbol of hope, providing vital resources for food, medical care, and a safe home for our four-legged friends. Together, we not only grow a token but also build a kinder world.</p>

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>Our mission comes to life through streaming on pump.fun and other platforms. Here's how we make a difference:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>**Streaming:** Tune in to my live streams on pump.fun. During the broadcasts, we will introduce the project, share updates, and most importantly, have fun together!</li>
                <li>**Active Community:** Every donation or interaction we receive on the stream, no matter the size, contributes directly to our fundraising goal.</li>
                <li>**100% to the Cause:** We are committed to ensuring that **100%** of what is raised during the streams is donated to animal shelters.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your participation is the force that fuels our mission. By joining, you become a hero for the animals.</p>
